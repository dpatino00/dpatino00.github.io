- title: Genome and Transcriptome Analysis of <em>Salmonella Enterica</em>*
  description: > 
    Designed a reproducible pipeline that assembled a genome from DNA-seq reads, assembled a de novo transcriptome from RNA-seq reads, 
    annotated the transcriptome, and predicted protein function using the KEGG database.

- title: QSAR Model to Predict Aquatic Toxicity - Modeling and Evaluation *
  description: >
    Employed gradient boosting, kNN with bagging, and RPART machine learning techniques to predict LC50 toxicity towards Daphnia magna, 
    with a focus on minimizing mean absolute error through fine-tuning.
