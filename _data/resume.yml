experience:
  - company: Moderna
    title: Data Science and AI Research Co-op
    location: Cambridge, MA
    date: January 2024 – June 2024
    duties:
      - Designed a parser that converts raw laboratory logs into CSV formats for nodes and edges, enabling graph-based modeling of automated lab processes on AWS Neptune
      - Built a prototype AI product that translates natural language into Gremlin graph query language, enhancing retrieval of information for non-technical users
      - Instituted an evaluation framework to continually assess and enhance AI prototype performance
      - Implemented a graph alignment algorithm for graph-to-table normalization to highlight differences in similar subgraphs, allowing scientists to draw insights from variations in lab processes

    title: Chemistry - Quality Control Associate II
    location: Norwood, MA
    date: July 2021 – Present
    duties:
      - Contributed to implementation and design of digital LES Worksheets on LIMS and conduct User Acceptance Testing for transfer of data from Chromeleon to LES Worksheets
      - Developed a Tableau dashboard that tracks key performance metrics (deviations/laboratory events)
      - Analyzed chromatography using Chromeleon to quantify mRNA and lipid concentrations and identify impurities
      - Supported QC Compliance with data integrity gap assessments on Chromeleon and SoftMax Pro software
      - Performed analytical tests on release, IPC, and stability samples in alignment to cGMP guidelines
      - Collaborated with AS&T and PD to transfer methods across sites and optimize assays

projects:
  - title: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) - Modeling and Ensemble Evaluation
    details:
      - Employed gradient boosting, kNN with bagging, and RPART machine learning techniques to predict LC50 toxicity towards Daphnia magna, with a focus on minimizing mean absolute error through fine-tuning
      - Developed and assessed an ensemble model using k-fold cross-validation to enhance predictive performance
  - title: Genome and Transcriptome Analysis of Salmonella enterica
    details:
      - Designed a reproducible pipeline that assembled a genome from DNA-seq reads, assembled a de novo transcriptome from RNA-seq reads, annotated the transcriptome, and predicted protein function using the KEGG database

research:
  - institution: Wake Forest University
    department: Department of Chemistry
    date: August 2020 – December 2020
    duties:
      - Synthesized and purified an SN-38 prodrug, utilizing 1H NMR to confirm molecular structure
      - Evaluated selectivity of the prodrug by confirming payload and selective release in response to reactive oxygen species
      - Performed cytotoxicity assays on cancerous and non-cancerous cells, deriving IC50 values to assess therapeutic potential
