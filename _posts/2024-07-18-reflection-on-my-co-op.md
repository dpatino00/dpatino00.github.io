A couple weeks ago I concluded my co-op experience with the Data Science & AI (DSAI) Research team at Moderna. In this blog post, I share a reflection of challenges I faced, skills I gained, and my personal growth throughout the experience. 

## Background

I pursued a Master of Science in Bioinformatics from Northeastern University alongside my full-time role as Quality Control Analyst at Moderna. As part of my program requirements, I had to do a co-op experience. Through support of my department, I was able to temporarily work half-time in Quality Control for six months, allowing me to secure a half-time co-op opportunity within Moderna. I would love to give special thanks to Eric Ma, my manager in DSAI, for his support in accommodating this  unconventional approach to a co-op. 

## Project Summary

The overall objective of my project was to leverage LLMs for robust translation of natural language to graph query language. The result of my project was an LLM workflow that simplifies data access for lab scientists, enabling them to query information from a graph database in natural language. In addition to breaking down this technical barrier, I prototyped a graph-to-table normalization algorithm to detect variations across queried subgraphs. This enhancement allows for scientists to draw insights more quickly. The end-to-end product takes a user query as an input, translates it into graph query language, and generates a dashboard for a more detailed analysis of the queried subgraphs.

## Challenges

Juggling two job functions and full-time classes was my biggest challenge. Prior to this experience, I was balancing full-time QC work with my studies, which was a shock the first couple months of my program. Despite the initial struggle, I was able to adapt and significantly improve my time management skills. This led me to believe handling two part-time roles with classes would not be much different. 

However, switching between school, Quality Control, and Data Science mode was more extensive than I expected. While I had developed efficient time management skills prior to starting, the new challenge was maintaining a high level of productivity and focus in each role. After completing my graduate coursework in late April, I felt accomplished and more mentally tough. This challenge taught me a valuable lesson in adaptability. 

## Communication Skills

While I gained many technical skills in data science from this experience, it is equally important to highlight soft skills that I developed along the way. One of the most significant skills was the ability to effectively present information to different audiences. I recognized the importance of communication in the field of data science, so I actively made it a goal of mine these six months to improve my presentation abilities. As I look back to my first presentation, I remember feeling nervous and unsure of how to convey complex concepts in a digestible manner. Throughout the six-month experience, I was given many opportunities to present, and allowing me to gain more confidence and clarity with each subsequent presentation.

## Personal Growth

Transitioning from a role in wet lab science to computational science can be intimidating. Additionally, navigating this transition as a first-generation Latino added another layer of difficulty. However, the supportive and inclusive environment fostered by my team enabled me to thrive and contribute meaningfully to my project. Throughout my professional career, I have recognized the difference between simply having diversity and embracing both diversity and inclusion. This experience highlighted for me the value these two principles for fostering innovation. It not only enhanced my ability to work effectively but also contributed to my personal growth by making me more confident in my skillset.
