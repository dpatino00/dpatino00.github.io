I have been working at [Moderna](https://www.modernatx.com/en-US) as a Quality Control Associate in the Chemistry Department for 3 years. Before entering the workforce, I graduated from [Wake Forest University](https://www.wfu.edu/) with a background in Medicinal Chemistry and Math. A couple months into working, my interdisciplinary interests led me to pursue and complete a Master of Science in Bioinformatics from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). Balancing a full-time job alongside full-time graduate school was a challenge, but I am thankful for all the learning experiences from mentors at both Moderna and Northeastern University. It was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding in mRNA science and how computational methods can be applied to biological problems. Throughout my program, I not only explored various bioinformatics tools, but also developed skills to interpret complex biological data.

As part of the Bioinformatics program, I also had the opportunity to participate in a co-op/industry project with the Data Science & AI (DSAI) Research team at Moderna. For six months, I worked half-time in Quality Control and half-time in DSAI, where my project focused on leveraging LLMs for translation of natural language to graph query language. I worked on a prototype AI product to facilate robust translation and learned the importance of an evaluation framework. This project provided me with hands-on experience with graph analysis using *networkx* and graph databases. Under the mentorship of Eric Ma, I learned many valuable tips on the best coding practices that I will carry forward with me in my future work.

I am dedicated to continue learning about applications of computational science within the biotech industry. As a first-gen Latino, I appreciate the opportunities that continuous learning offers. I am thankful for my parents who inspried and supported me along the way. This background has given me strong drive to make an impact in the biotech world, and I hope to inspire others from a similar background to pursue their goals in the STEM field.
